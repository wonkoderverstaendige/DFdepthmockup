Purpose: Make mockup similar to the one posted by Mayday (http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=41266.0), automatically and with shaded slopes

How: 

1) Disect screenshots
    - crop if necessary
        - check for repetitions -> tile size
	- Tile batch of screenshots automatically 
	- sort tiles into a dictionary
		- normalize tiles into ascending palette (independent of shading)
		- alt: use a provided tileset file

2) Build representation
	- find borders, find slope tiles (up/down)
	- Create z-mask for combining
	- get vector field for slopes (direction and context of surrounding slopes)
		- slopes: linear, cos(0-pi)
	
3) Order layers
	- detect z-order based on numbers on lower right side/changes in area
	- alt: find sky tile by uniformity, use sky tile by growing area for upper limits, find earth tiles for lower limits
	- alt: start with sky, where sky replaced, next layer is ground/something, trace full stack down, ascending by level of sky tiles
	
4) Combine into single image
	- binary masking alpha channel
	- alt: tile by tile, only highest non-zero (sky) tile, shade by distance from highest (current) level
		- Shade higher levels blueish, lower levels darkish?

F) Fun things
	? shadows based on date -> season indicator (doesn't make much sense, but then again, DF!)
	? detect water slopes on blue content
	? draw beaches
	? draw water depth by shading with very dark blue->cyan
